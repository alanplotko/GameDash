# Gaming Activity Dashboard (GAD)

### About

GAD will allow the end user to monitor their gaming activity. Essentially, a user can link accounts such as Steam and keep track of their activity. Online monitors and dashboards already exist so what will set GAD apart are the various statistics it will compile about the user's gaming activity. The name is temporary and is given as such to be explicit in that the project will focus on gaming communities such as Steam and use their APIs to collect data. If I come across other APIs for alternatives to Steam, I hope to integrate them as well and collect additional statistics on what the end user frequently uses (e.g. an end user that uses both Steam and Origin, but is more active on one than the other by some percentage or unit of time). For gaming communities like Uplay that do not have an API, I will be considering writing scrapers that take in a username as input and collect specific data (e.g. hours played, games played, community totals). 

### Future Plans

- Look into GOG Galaxy and if there will be an API
